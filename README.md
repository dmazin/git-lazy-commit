# git-lazy-commit

git-lazy-commit generates commit messages for staged changes in a git repository using OpenAI's OpenGPT.

This tool is great at describing what you did, but not why you did it. I'd advise you to use it as a starting point, but then add the _why_. Use AI to augment yourself, not replace yourself.

For more backstory and discussion, please see [my blog post about this](https://www.cyberdemon.org/2023/03/27/git-lazy-commit.html).

## Installation

You can install the ChatGPT Commit Assistant using pip: `pip install git-lazy-commit`

You can upgrade it using `pip install --upgrade git-lazy-commit`.

## Usage

After staging some changes (`git add <glob>`), call `git-lazy-commit`. It will generate a commit message for the staged changes. By "staged changes", I mean the changes that you have run `git add` on, but not yet committed, i.e. the ones returned by `git diff --staged`.

You need to be an OpenAI user to use git-lazy-commit, and you need to specify where to find your API key. Here is the precedence for where I look for the API key.

1. `--api-key-path <path>`
2. `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
3. `~/.openai-api-key`

You can create keys at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.

For example:

```
$ cd my-git-repo
$ git add .
$ git-lazy-commit
Generated commit message: Update version to 0.12 and remove print statement
Do you approve this commit message? ((y)es/(n)o/(e)ditor):
```

If you press y/yes, it will commit your change with the proposed message. If you press n/no, it will try coming up with another message. If you press e/editor, it will open up $EDITOR and let you modify the message before comitting.

If you want to exit the script, press Ctrl+C.

You can pass the model you want to use using `-m/--model`, e.g. `-m gpt-4`. The default is `gpt-3-turbo`. Note that gpt-4 is quite a bit slower and more expensive. `gpt-3-turbo`, on the other hand, is extremely cheap (it's costing me less than 10 cents a day to use this).

You can also pass `--verbose` to see some extra info, like the token usage.

## Acknowledgement

It should not be surprising that this tool was itself mostly generated by ChatGPT (the GPT-4 version), except for `chatbot.py`, which was written by Simon Willison and discussed in [this blog post](https://til.simonwillison.net/gpt3/chatgpt-api).

## Examples

Here's a diff from my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/dmazin/dotfiles) where I added the direnv plugin to oh-my-zsh.

```diff

```

**what I'd have written if I wasn't lazy**: add direnv plugin to oh-my-zsh

**git-lazy-commit**: feat: add direnv plugin to zshrc base configuration file

Note that it prepended a silly little "feat:". It's not perfect! For this reason, git-lazy-commit lets you edit the proposed commit message using the $EDITOR of your choice.

Another example, Here's a diff from the git-lazy-commit repo, where I gave up trying to generate the diff with GitPython (I couldn't figure out how to make its output match `git diff --staged`) and just used subprocess to run `git diff --staged` directly.

**what I'd have written if I wasn't lazy**: Use subprocess to call `git diff --staged` instead of trying to get gitpython to print what I want

Here, I wanted update the interactivity of git-lazy-commit to allow a user to enter "y" instead of "yes" (etc). I also bumped the version.
